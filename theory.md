# mm-ADT
## A Cluster-Oriented Virtual Machine Architecture

---

The mm-ADT virtual machine has two primary functions. The first is to coordinate any number of processing engines and storage systems within a compute cluster. The second is to enable users to specify computations (i.e. queries or programs) to be executed across the cluster.

## The Obj

The most fundamental structure in mm-ADT is `obj`&mdash;object.

## The Inst

There is special `obj` called `inst`&mdash;instruction.
