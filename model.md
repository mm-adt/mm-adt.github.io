The mm-ADT Effect
-----------------

The mm-ADT software development group is a collection of loosely acquainted
engineers focused on developing mm-ADT compliant data technologies. 

## ROLES
  * User: A user of any technology developed in mm-ADT.
    * Contributor: A user the contributes technology back to mm-ADT.
    * Customer: A user with a licensing agreement with RReduX,Inc.
  * Partner: Anyone currently or historically connected with an mm-ADT project.
    * Creator: A member that created or was voted into a project for long-term.

## PROJECTS

The primary project is the mm-ADT virtual machine (mm-ADT VM) which specifies
the general architecture whereby all other mm-ADT projects must relate. 

* Every mm-ADT project has its own repository.
* Every mm-ADT project has a namespace of the form `xyz.mm-adt.org`.
* Every mm-ADT project has two mailing lists: `public@` and `private@`.
  * Public mailing lists are how creators support their users (thus, customers).
  * Private mailing lists are how creators discuss internal economics/politics.
* Every mm-ADT project has a homepage with documentation.

### PROJECT CREATION

Any user can propose a project to the mm-ADT public mailing list. The act of propsing 
a project makes the user a contributor. The contributor's proposal is submitted via a
[DISCUSS] posting. A discussion can go on for an indefinite amount of time. 
When the contributor has worked out their argument, a [VOTE] can be proposed. 
Voting is done on a -1,0,+1 scale over a 1 week window. The votes are tallied and 
the result can be positive (approved), zero (delayed), and negative (denied).

If the final [VOTE] is positive, then a private repository is created for the contributor's
project. At this point, the contributor is a creator (and thus, an mm-ADT partner).

A project is maintained in a private repository until its debut release. The first release
requires a [VOTE] from all mm-ADT partners. However, all subsequent releases are voted on by 
the project creators.

### PROJECT DELIVERABLES
Every release, the project creators must turn in the following items:

* A summary of their changes.
* A license price.
  * The model (subscription, perpetual, etc.) is constrained by RReduX infrastructure.
  * Creators are responsible for setting a price.
  * The submitted license cost is finalized with a [VOTE] amongst the creators.
* A revenue distribution.
  * A [VOTE] is required across all mm-ADT partners to the proposed distribution.
  * Only creators of that project receive distributions.
  * The submitted distribution can't change until the next release.
  * Creators are paid according to the distribution within 45 days of receipt of revenue.
  * Creators maintain a "1099 direct deposit" relationship with RReduX,Inc.
