# mm-ADT
## A Cluster-Oriented Virtual Machine Architecture

---

<a href="assets/images/posters/sculpture-classes.jpg"><img src="assets/images/posters/sculpture-classes.jpg" class="rimg" width="120"/></a> The mm-ADT virtual machine is programmed using a low-level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode">bytecode</a> language that is specifically designed to integrate a heterogeneous collection of processing engines and storage systems. An mm-ADT _program_ is a semi-cyclic graph of primitive functional operations called _instructions_. These instructions can be executed naturally by any processor based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming">reactive pattern</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a>, or any asynchronous or batch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing">message-passing</a> architecture. Processors drive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence">swarms</a> of traverser-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">monads</a> over data structures stored in systems ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">databases</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access">random-access</a> data paths to distributed file systems with linear data layouts optimized for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_access">sequential-access</a> processing. Data structures are sorted into _model-ADTs_ using mm-ADT's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">type system</a> which is capable of expressing canonical-types, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinement_type">refinement-types</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type">dependent-types</a> in support of universal, general-purpose, cluster-oriented, distributed computing.
