# mm-ADT
## An Open Source Perspective

---

Open source software development is no longer the toil of the "hobbyist." The open source models that were developed 20 years ago have not evolved to address the social and economic hardships that developers now face. The mm-ADT open source model offers world-class developers an economic experience that is more natural, sustainable, and aimed at satisfying their ultimate desire: the carefree execution of their talent.

### Independent Open Source Developers Suffer Economically

Independent open source developers spend their time developing software that provides no financial compensation and, as the popularity of their project increases, success can lead  to burnout and financial ruin. 

### Corporate Open Source Developers Sacrifice Autonomy 

Corporate open source developers are in the problematic situation where their work is dependent on their sponsoring organization who also controls the direction and pace of development as well as the interoperability and inclusion of any novel innovations within the project.

### Entrepreneurial Open Source Developers Lack a Competitive Edge

Entrepreneurial open source developers may form a company around their open source project. Unfortunately, such companies are easily obviated in the market because the core product is freely licensed and competing firms can offer the same product without having to invest in the research and development effort.

### Open Source Software Isn't Free

The free availability of open source software has led to the erroneous impression that software does not have an intrinsic value. The consequence has been the creation of technology companies with _inverted_ business models based on support contracts, premium features, and other solutions auxiliary to the primary source of value&mdash;the open source core.

### World-Class Developers A Competent Marketers

The free open source software foundations require developers to define, create, document, support, and market their technology. Through project mailing lists, social media site, blogs, as well as via conference speaking engagements and academic articles, open source development teams are well-rounded _value creating machines_.

### Corporate Infrastructure Is An Unnecessary Cost

Corporate management structures are an unnecessary appendage to a world-class software development team. This has been proven time and again by the high-quality, self-governed projects of the open source software foundations. Likewise, marketing and sales structures make less sense when projects naturally sell themselves by being well documented, promoted, and where the source can be reviewed, downloaded, integrated, tested, and benchmarked all prior to adoption by the consumer.

### The Free Market Determines Product Value

mm-ADT seeks to create a simple, fair open source economy devoid of contorting financial mechanism such as investors, stock options, bonuses, raises, performance reviews, power hierarchies, and other complications that only serve to obfuscate the developer's true worth. mm-ADT empowers developers by offering them direct access to the free and open market. 

### Interoperability Enables Deeper Specialization

mm-ADT integrates open source data projects into a general-purpose data processing platform. For developers, ease of integration means the freedom to specialize knowing that their contributions will integrate with other complementary technologies across mm-ADT. For commercial organizations, this means its easy to expand product offerings and evolve as data processing fashions come and go. As for users, the benefit from being able to use their preferred query languages to control an assortment of specialized processors to compute over storage systems optimized to their application's data access requirements.

### Aligning Societal and Individual Incentives

Technological advancement occur when developers with unique skills and perspectives take technical risks. In the mm-ADT model, when such behaviors lead to successful products, the developer is compensated in direct proportion to the value they created in the economy.
