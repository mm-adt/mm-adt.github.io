mm-ADT is a distributed virtual machine aimed at integrating the plethora of open source storage systems, processing engines, and query languages. This is accomplished through a set of three language-agnostic interface. When a valid implementation of a respective interface is created, the interfacing component is considered _mm-ADT compliant_ and is able to communicate with any other mm-ADT compliant component. In this manner, query language developers can develop languages irrespective of the underlying storage system that will ultimately be manipulated by the language. Similarly, processing engines can be programmed by any query language and for use over any any storage system. Finally, storage systems (such as databases) automatically support all mm-ADT compliant query languages and processors.

From relational to graph query language, real-time to batch analytics, and from single machine to cluster-oriented storage systems, mm-ADT enables data system engineers to tailor their data technologies architecture to their specific application requirements.

## Mission

mm-ADT integrates open source data projects from the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/), [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/), and other related OSS foundations. Like the mm-ADT VM, every mm-ADT component is dual licensed, where the developers of those components can capitalize on the fruits of their labor through revenue from license sales. The goal is to provide developers a direct connection to the economic streams generated by their creative prowess.

## Components

The mm-ADT VM is the integration point of query languages, processors, and storage systems. The following itemizations outline the desired near-term components. Engineers from these projects are invited to contact RReduX,Inc. to discuss how they can participate in mm-ADT and earn revenue from license sales.

### Query Languages

* [ISO SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL): the most popular relational query languages.
* [Facebook GraphQL](http://graphql.org/): a path-based query language for tree-structured data.
* [TinkerPop Gremlin](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html): a traversal query language for graph-structured data.
* [ISO GQL](http://www.gqlstandards.org/): a hybrid relational/traversal query language for graph structured data.
* [W3C SPARQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/): a pattern-matching query language for triple and quad-based data.

### Processing Engines

* [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/): A reactive stream processor for single-machine, multi-threaded data processing.
* [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org): An batch analytics processor for cluster-oriented computing.
* [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org): A near-time analytics processor for cluster-oriented computing.
* [Apache Beam](http://beam.apache.org): A unification framework for popular stream processors.
* [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org): A batch analytics processor for cluster-oriented computing.
* [Lightbend Akka](http://akka.io): A message-passing, co-location processor for distributed computing.

### Storage Systems

* [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org): A master-less, wide-column distributed database.
* [Apache HBase](http://hbase.apache.org): A wide-column distributed database for the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.
* [Apache Ignite](http://ignite.apache.org): A distributed key-value/relational database.
* [Apache TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.apache.org): A unification framework for graph databases and processors.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A distributed, document-oriented database in support of JSON storage and querying.
* [Facebook RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/): A foundational data storage system based on key/value semantics.
