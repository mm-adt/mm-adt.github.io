mm-ADT is a distributed computing virtual machine aimed at integrating data storage systems, processing engines, and query languages. A collection of language-agnostic interfaces is made available to each technology community and when a valid implementation of said interfaces is created, the interfacing component is considered _mm-ADT compliant_ and can communicate with any other mm-ADT compliant component. In this manner, query language developers can develop languages irrespective of the underlying storage system that will ultimately be manipulated by the language. Similarly, processing engine developers can have their processors programmed by any query language for data stored in any storage system. Finally, storage systems (such as databases) immediately support any all mm-ADT compliant query languages and processors in support of the variegated requirements of their end users' data processing requirements.

## Mission

mm-ADT is focused on integrating the many open source data projects currently sponsored by the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/), [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/), and other related OSS foundations. mm-ADT bindings enable the mm-ADT VM access to these components. Each binding is dual licensed in the same manner as the mm-ADT VM, with the developers of those bindings earning the revenue their work generates from license sales. The goal is to provide developers of successful data technologies a steady income stream, where the best engineers' no longer require company sponsorship, but instead, can have a direct connection to the revenue streams generated by their creative endeavors.

## Licensing
