## Tenets

### Technological Progress Requires Independent Engineers

The open source software foundations use a license that is beneficial to consumers, but at this point in time in our history, detrimental to producers&mdash;the developers. In order for talented engineers to earn a living with their open source software, they have to find a company willing to pay them to do so. There is a problem with this situation. The developers' ability to continue their work is now dependent on their sponsoring organization who also is in control of the direction and pace of development. This is especially problematic when these technologies become fundamental to our nation's data infrastructure. For entrepreneurial developers, a company is typically formed around their open source project. Many startups over the last decade did just this. Unfortunately, these companies were easily obviated in the market because their core product was freely licensed and larger tech firms could build an identical product without having to invest in its research and development effort. This is a major conceptual/economic-"loophole" (entailment) that currently resides in our open source foundations' free software licenses. Free software is harmful to everyone in a monopolistic economic environment as it has led to short-term monetary gains at the expense of the retardation of the creative spirit of our engineers. In summary, encumbered engineers stifles technological progress.

### Commercial Organizations Should Pay for the Software They Use

Free open source software has led to the erroneous impression that the only value in software is in support contracts. Many companies that were founded on open source technology are forced into a business model that uses support to compensate all of the talented engineers who have built the software. This has had the effect of externalizing costs for companies by turning software into a free and public utility without taxation. This has placed the burden of wealth generation back onto the engineer who now must perform above and beyond what they have already done with creating the software in the first place.

### Let Code Speak For Itself

The free open source software foundations depend on project developers to define, create, document, support, and market their technology. Developers in these self-governed projects have become proficient at these tasks. Through project mailing lists, social media accounts, websites, as well as through conference speaking engagements and academic articles, the developer and his open source colleagues are a full-stack _value creating machine_. The management infrastructure in software firms is no longer necessary for overseeing the creation of software being developed at the world-class level. This has been proven time and again in the self-governed projects of the open source software foundations. Next, the corporate infrastructure around marketing and sales only serves to detract from the consumer's ultimate task of objectively measuring a project's ability to solve their problem. Open source software is typically well documented, promoted, and the source can be reviewed, downloaded, integrated, tested, and benchmarked all prior to adoption. All the while, as the consumer goes through this process, they can talk directly to the developers on project mailing lists and social media sites. This level of direct constructive communication between open source developer and their commercial consumers only further demonstrates the economic costs that management infrastructure incurs upon the economy of software development.

### Individual Efforts are More Powerful in an EcoSystem

The mm-ADT marketplace is built on the idea that interconnectivity between technology leads to a necessary specialization ... experts in very specific domains can contribute to an ecosystem of technologies that benefit users (customized), developers (no longer work in domains they are not experts to provide a well rounded offering), and companies who want to appeal to a larger array of customers.
