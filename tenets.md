## Tenets

### Technological Progress Requires Independent Engineers

The open source software foundations use a license that is beneficial to software, but at this point in time in our history, detrimental to developers. In order for talented engineers to earn a living with their open source software, they have to find a software company willing to pay them to do so. The are two problems with this situation. 

  * If the developer is entrepreneurial, the developer will create their own company around their open source product. Many startups over the last decade did just this. Unfortunately, these companies were easily obviated in the market because their core product was freely licensed and larger tech firms could build an identical product without having to invest in the research and development effort.
  * If the developer is not business oriented, the developer will take a position in a company that uses their open source software. The developer's ability to continue their work is now dependent on their sponsoring company. Moreover, the sponsoring company has influence over the direction and pace of development. This stifles technological development.

### Commercial Organizations Should Pay for the Software They Use

Free open source software has led to the erroneous impression that the only value in software is in support contracts. Many companies that were founded on open source technology are forced into a business model that uses support to compensate all of the talented engineers who have built the software on which our current technological infrastructure is based. This has externalized cost for companies and placed the burden on wealth generation onto the engineers to perform above and beyond what they have already done with creating the software in the first place.

### Let Code Speak For Itself

The free open source software foundations rely on the engineers to define, create, document, and market their technology. Developers in these self-governed projects have become proficient at these tasks. Through project mailing lists, social media accounts, project websites, conference speaking engagements, academic articles, and educational material, the developer and his open source colleagues are a _full-stack value creating machine_. The corporate infrastructure around marketing and sales only serves to detract from objectively measuring a project's technological superiority. It is easy to know whether an open source project will be useful for the problem at hand because it can be reviewed, downloaded, integrated, and tested -- along with asking questions directly to the developers on project mailing lists. Furthermore, management is no longer required to oversee the creation of world-class software. By removing this layer of bureaucracy, open source developers have direct access to the  market along with the freedom to execute their creative solutions.

### Individual Efforts are More Powerful in an EcoSystem

The mm-ADT marketplace is built on the idea that interconnectivity between technology leads to a necessary specialization ... experts in very specific domains can contribute to an ecosystem of technologies that benefit users (customized), developers (no longer work in domains they are not experts to provide a well rounded offering), and companies who want to appeal to a larger array of customers.
