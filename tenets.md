# mm-ADT
## An Open Source Institute

mm-ADT&#8482; enables open source developers to continue to write free open source software while side-stepping two common problems associated with this chosen lifestyle: 1.) the complications associated with corporate sponsorship and 2.) the economic burdens of unemployment. 

### Independent Open Source Developers Suffer Economically

Idependent open source developers spend their time developing software that provides no tangible compensation and in fact, as the popularity of their project increases, can lead them to burnout and financial ruin.

### Corporate Open Source Developers Sacrafice Creative Freedom 

Open source developers can earn a living by working for companies willing to pay them to do open source development. The developer is in the problematic situation where their work is dependent on their sponsoring organization who now also controls the direction and pace of development as well as the interoperability and inclusion of any novel innovations within the project.

### Entrepreneurial Open Source Developers Lack a Competitive Edge

Developers with a more entrepreneurial spirit may form a company around their open source project. Many startups over the last decade did just this. Unfortunately, these companies were easily obviated in the market because their core product was freely licensed and larger tech firms were able to offer identical products without having to invest in the research and development effort. This is a major conceptual/economic-"loophole" (entailment) in the industry's use of free software licenses at this point in time.

### Open Source Software Isn't Free

The free availability of open source software has led to the erroneous impression that software does not have an intrinsic value. The consequence has been the creation of technology companies with _inverted_ business models based on support contracts, premium features, and other solutions auxiliary to the primary source of value&mdash;the open source core. This model discredits the indispensable role of talented developers in the economy, where their software has become ubiquitous and, for many top projects, vital to our world's data infrastructure.

### World-Class Developers Understand Marketing and Outreach

The free open source software foundations require developers to define, create, document, support, and market their technology. Developers in these self-governed projects have become proficient at these tasks. Through project mailing lists, social media site, blogs, as well as via conference speaking engagements and academic articles, the developer and his open source colleagues are a full-on _value creating machine_.

### Corporate Infrastructure Is An Unecessary Cost

Top-down corporate management is an unnecessary appendage to a world-class software development team. This has been proven time and again by the high-quality, self-governed projects of the open source software foundations. Likewise, corporate marketing and sales infrastructure provide little value for top-quality projects that naturally sell themselves by being well documented, promoted, and where the source can be reviewed, downloaded, integrated, tested, and benchmarked all prior to adoption by the consumer. Quality open source software is not born nor maintained by corporate infrastructure, but by competent, self-motivated developers.

### The Free Market Determines Product Value

mm-ADT seeks to create a simple, fair open source economy devoid of contorting financial mechanism such as investors, stock options, bonuses, raises, performance reviews, power hierarchies, and other complications that only serve to obfuscate the developer's true worth. mm-ADT empowers developers by offering them direct access to the free and open market. 

### Interoperable Data Technologies Enable Deeper Specialization

mm-ADT integrates open source data projects into a general-purpose data processing platform. For developers, ease of integration means the freedom to specialize knowing that their contributions will integrate with other complementary technologies across mm-ADT. For commercial organizations, this means its easy to expand product offerings with the latest open source advances. For users, this means being able to use preferred query languages to control specialized processors over storage systems optimized to their application's data access requirements.
