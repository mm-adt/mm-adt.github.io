## Tenets

### Technological Progress Requires Independent Engineers

The open source software foundations use a license that is beneficial to consumers, but at this point in time in our history, detrimental to producers&mdash;
the developers. In order for talented engineers to earn a living with their open source software, they have to find a company willing to pay them to do so. There is a problem with this situation. The developers' ability to continue their work is now dependent on their sponsoring organization who also is in control of direction and pace of development. This is an unnecessary complication to the developers' vision. For entrepreneurial developers, a company is typically formed around their open source project. Many startups over the last decade did just this. Unfortunately, these companies were easily obviated in the market because their core product was freely licensed and larger tech firms could build an identical product without having to invest in the research and development effort. This is a major conceptual/economic-loophole that currently resides in our open source foundations' free software licenses. Free software is harmful to everyone in a monopolistic economic environment. It has led to short-term gains at the expense of the retardation of the creative spirit of our engineers. In summary, encumbered engineers stifles technological progress.

### Commercial Organizations Should Pay for the Software They Use

Free open source software has led to the erroneous impression that the only value in software is in support contracts. Many companies that were founded on open source technology are forced into a business model that uses support to compensate all of the talented engineers who have built the software on which most of our world's current software infrastructure is based. This has externalized cost for companies by turning software into a free and public utility. This has placed the burden of wealth generation back onto the engineer to now perform above and beyond what they have already done with creating the software in the first place. Fortunately, this level of pressure has honed over the last couple of decades a uniquely talented individual: creativity along with an understanding of the market.

### Let Code Speak For Itself

The free open source software foundations depend on project developers to define, create, document, support, and market their technology. Developers in these self-governed projects have become proficient at these tasks. Through project mailing lists, social media accounts, project websites, conference speaking engagements, academic articles, and educational material, the developer and his open source colleagues are a full-stack _value creating machine_. The corporate infrastructure around marketing and sales only serves to detract from the consumer's ultimate task of objectively measuring a project's ability to solve their problem. Open source software can be reviewed, downloaded, integrated, tested, and benchmarked all prior to adoption. While going through that process, for all other unknowns, consumers can talk directly to the developers on project mailing lists and social media sites. Furthermore, the management infrastructure in software firms is no longer necessary for overseeing the creation software at the world-class level. This has been proven many times over by the open source software foundations. By removing this bureaucratic appendage, open source developers have the freedom to perform their creative solutions in direct communication with their audience: the consumers and their problems.

### Individual Efforts are More Powerful in an EcoSystem

The mm-ADT marketplace is built on the idea that interconnectivity between technology leads to a necessary specialization ... experts in very specific domains can contribute to an ecosystem of technologies that benefit users (customized), developers (no longer work in domains they are not experts to provide a well rounded offering), and companies who want to appeal to a larger array of customers.
