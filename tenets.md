## Tenets
 
### Technological Progress Requires Independent Engineers

Open source software foundation licenses are beneficial to consumers and, at this point in time in our history, detrimental to producers&mdash;the developers. In order for talented engineers to earn a living with their open source software, they have to find a company willing to pay them to continue development. The developer is in the problematic situation where their work is dependent on their sponsoring organization who now also controls the direction and pace of development as well as the interoperability and inclusion of any novel innovations.

Developers with a more entrepreneurial spirit may form a company around their open source project. Many startups over the last decade did just this. Unfortunately, these companies were easily obviated in the market because their core product was freely licensed and larger tech firms could build an identical product without having to invest in the research and development effort. This is a major conceptual/economic-"loophole" (entailment) in our open source foundations' free software licenses. The professional lives of open source software developers are overly complicated because the software they spend their time developing provides no tangible compensation and in fact, as the popularity of their project increases, can lead to burnout and financial ruin.

### Corporations Externalize Software Costs to Private Individuals

The free availability of open source software has led to the erroneous impression that software does not have an intrinsic value. The consequence has been the creation of technology companies with inverted business models based on support contracts, premium features, and other solutions auxiliary to the primary source of value&mdash;the open source software core. This model discredits the indispensable role of talented developers in the economy, where their software has become ubiquitous and, for many top projects, vital to our world's data infrastructure. At this point in time, with the massive profits being made by large tech firms, open source software should be a means of alleviating the financial burdens many developers experience.

### Successful Projects Do Not Require Corporate Infrastructure

The free open source software foundations require developers to define, create, document, support, and market their technology. Developers in these self-governed projects have become proficient at these tasks. Through project mailing lists, social media accounts, websites, as well as via conference speaking engagements and academic articles, the developer and his open source colleagues are a top-to-bottom _value creating machine_. Top-down, corporate management is an unnecessary appendage to a world-class software development team. This has been proven time and again by the high-quality, self-governed projects of the open source software foundations. Likewise, corporate marketing and sales infrastructure provides little value for top-quality software that sells itself by being well documented, promoted, and where the source can be reviewed, downloaded, integrated, tested, and benchmarked all prior to adoption by the consumer. Quality open source software is not born nor maintained by corporate infrastructure, but by competent, self-motivated developers.

### Interoperable Data Technologies Enable Deeper Specialization

mm-ADT integrates a plethora of open source projects into a general-purpose data processing platform. For developers, ease of integration means the freedom to specialize knowing that their contributions will integrate with other complementary technologies across the mm-ADT landscape. For commercial organizations, this means its easy to expand product offerings with the latest open source data technologies. Finally, for users, this means being able to use preferred query languages to program specialized processors over storage systems optimized to their application's data access requirements.
